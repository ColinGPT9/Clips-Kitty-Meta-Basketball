# Clips Kitty Meta relay

A small Cloudflare Worker (with a D1 database) that sits between a
creator's phone, Meta's APIs, and the Clips Kitty PC. New for the Meta
hackathon edition. The creator deploys their own; it is single-tenant.

- Sends WhatsApp messages (Cloud API) and receives WhatsApp webhooks.
- Serves the phone's approval page.
- Runs Facebook Login and Threads Login, and keeps the tokens (sealed).
- Makes the Instagram, Facebook and Threads Graph API calls for an approved
  publish, streaming the rendered file the PC sends it.
- Hosts the connector for the creator's Muse agent: an MCP server at
  `POST /mcp`, the same tools at `/muse/v1/...`, their OpenAPI description at
  `/muse/openapi.json`, and a setup guide at `/muse`. Muse reads offers and
  results and can remind or cancel; it can't approve or publish. See
  [MUSE_CONNECTOR.md](../docs/hackathon/meta/MUSE_CONNECTOR.md).

The PC only ever calls out to it with signed requests; it never calls the
PC. See [docs/hackathon/meta/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/hackathon/meta/ARCHITECTURE.md)
and [SECURITY.md](../docs/hackathon/meta/SECURITY.md).

## Deploy

Full steps, including the Meta app: [WHATSAPP_SETUP.md](../docs/hackathon/meta/WHATSAPP_SETUP.md)
and [META_PUBLISHING.md](../docs/hackathon/meta/META_PUBLISHING.md). In short:

```
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler d1 create clips-kitty-relay        # put database_id in wrangler.toml
npx wrangler d1 execute clips-kitty-relay --remote --file=schema.sql
# set PUBLIC_URL (and optionally WHATSAPP_DISPLAY_NUMBER) in wrangler.toml
for s in ENROLL_KEY TOKEN_KEY WHATSAPP_TOKEN WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID WHATSAPP_WABA_ID \
         WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN META_APP_ID META_APP_SECRET THREADS_APP_ID THREADS_APP_SECRET; do
  npx wrangler secret put $s
done
npx wrangler deploy
```

Webhook: `https://<relay>/webhook` (fields: `messages`,
`message_template_status_update`). OAuth redirects:
`https://<relay>/oauth/facebook/callback` and `https://<relay>/oauth/threads/callback`.

## Run it locally with Meta faked

```
npm test                      # 58 tests: node --test, D1 on node:sqlite, Meta faked
npm run dev                   # http://127.0.0.1:8787, prints an enrolment key
```

`npm run dev` runs the real `worker.js` with `test/serve.mjs`, whose
`/__mock/*` routes play the phone (send a message, tap a button, a delivery
status), finish an OAuth sign-in, run the cron, and move the clock. Nothing
is sent to WhatsApp or posted anywhere. `scripts/meta_demo.py` uses it for
the end-to-end demo.

Needs Node 22.5+ (for `node:sqlite`; the npm scripts pass `--experimental-sqlite`,
which it needs before Node 22.13). No npm dependencies.

## Files

| File | What |

| `worker.js` | Routes, pairing, notify (offers kept for Muse when WhatsApp is off), the approval page's actions, the PIN lockouts, Muse keys for the PC, commands, the Graph step gate, cron |
| `lib/whatsapp.js` | Cloud API sends, the four templates, error meanings, the 24-hour window |
| `lib/meta.js` | Facebook Login, Threads Login and refresh, the Graph steps, uploads to rupload |
| `lib/page.js` | The approval and status pages (server-rendered, no JavaScript) |
| `lib/crypto.js` | HMAC, AES-GCM sealing, PBKDF2 PIN hashing, canonical JSON |
| `lib/muse.js` | The Muse connector: MCP, the REST routes, the OpenAPI description, keys and their rate limit |
| `lib/db.js` | D1 helpers, the audit log, and the PIN lockout block |
| `schema.sql` | The D1 schema (run it again on a relay deployed before the Muse connector: it only adds what is missing) |
| `test/` | The harness (D1 on node:sqlite, FakeMeta), the tests, and the local server |
