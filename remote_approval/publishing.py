"""One approved clip, published to the platforms the phone chose.

Called by the publish worker (server/publisher.py _publish) for a publish
job whose request says provider "meta". It runs on that worker's thread, so
it inherits its rules: one upload at a time, a crash mid-upload leaves the
job 'interrupted' and it is never sent again by itself.

Before anything leaves this PC the job is checked against its offer once
more: the offer is still in a publishing state, the job's command is the
one that approved it, and the file is byte-for-byte the size and mtime that
was offered. Then each platform in order, Instagram and Facebook first so
Threads has a confirmed link to point at. Each platform's outcome is written
to clip_publishes (provider "meta", request_id = the approval id) as it
happens, so a platform that already succeeded is never posted again by a
retry.
