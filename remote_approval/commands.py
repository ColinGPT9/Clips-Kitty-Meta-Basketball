"""What a decision made on the phone is allowed to do, checked on this PC.

The relay already checked the link, the PIN and the expiry before it handed
a command over. This module checks again, against this PC's own record of
the offer, because the PC is the one about to post a video in the
creator's name and a relay is a server on the internet:

* the command is signed with this PC's device secret (relay.verify_command);
* it has not been seen before (remote_commands): a command delivered twice
  is acknowledged twice and applied once;
* it names an offer this PC made, by the relay's approval id AND this PC's
  own id for it, so an approval can only ever apply to the job it was for;
* the clips' fingerprint matches the offer's, and every chosen clip is
  still the same file on disk, so an old approval never applies to new or
  re-rendered clips;
* it was decided before the offer expired, and is not stale (a PC that was
  off for days does not post on its return without asking again);
* remote approval is still switched on here, and each platform is one this
  creator connected.

A generic "yes" cannot pass: an approve names its offer, its fingerprint,
its clips and its platforms, or it is refused.
